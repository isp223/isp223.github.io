## About Me

My name is Isabel Prado. I was born and raised in Guatemala. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Business and Economics at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, PA, I am graduating on May 2023. I am double majoring in Finance and Business Analytics and have also chosen to pursue a double minor in Engineering and Business Information Systems.

Through my coursework, I have gained knowledge in a variety of business-related areas, including Investments, Security Analysis & Portfolio, Financial Accounting, and Predictive Analytics in Business. These courses have provided me with a solid understanding of financial concepts, such as investment strategies, financial statement analysis, and data analytics.

In addition to my major, I am also interested in the technical aspects of business, which is why I chose to pursue a double minor in Engineering and Business Information Systems. These minors have allowed me to gain knowledge in areas such as systems analysis and data management, which I believe will be valuable in my future career.

## Hobbies

Growing up in Guatemala helping my community has always been very important for me. I've worked with different non-profit organizations. 
  - With America Reads/Counts program, I mentored and tutored middle school students to improve their reading and math skills. I have also volunteered at the Public Cancer Hospital UNICAR, collaborating in a program focused on emotional well-being to support children with cancer and low-income families. I volunteered and taught at Casa del Alfarero, a program focused on health and nutrition development for malnourished children of single mothers. During my time there, I taught weekly English classes to low-income children. Overall, I find joy in volunteering and helping others through education, health, and emotional support programs. 
  
I also enjoy playing tennis and the piano in my free time.
