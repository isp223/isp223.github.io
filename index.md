## About Me

My name is Isabel Prado. I was born and raised in Guatemala. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Business and Economics at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, PA, with an expected graduation date of May 2023. I am double majoring in Finance and Business Analytics and have also chosen to pursue a double minor in Engineering and Business Information Systems.

Through my coursework, I have gained knowledge in a variety of business-related areas, including Investments, Security Analysis & Portfolio, Financial Accounting, and Predictive Analytics in Business. These courses have provided me with a solid understanding of financial concepts, such as investment strategies, financial statement analysis, and data analytics.

In addition to my major, I am also interested in the technical aspects of business, which is why I chose to pursue a double minor in Engineering and Business Information Systems. These minors have allowed me to gain knowledge in areas such as systems analysis and data management, which I believe will be valuable in my future career.

My work at Diaz- Bazan Asset Management involved an internship from August 2021 in Boston. During this time, I reviewed economic fundamentals and credit ratings to select investment ideas in bonds. I also analyzed the impact of changes in US interest rates on the pricing of emerging market sovereign debt and prepared reports on my economic analysis and research results to share with the head trader.
